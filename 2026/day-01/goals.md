Current level: A BTech graduate, going back to become a student

Goals: To become an ENGINEER, who is able to solve problems
       Want to learn the necessary tools to become a good DevOps engineer
       Deploy an application and automate it end-to-end
       Learn concepts and understand them so that I am able to solve scenario based problems

Skills: Will learn Linux to a level where I can troubleshoot problems
        Want to learn how CI/CD pipelines work
        Apart from Docker and Kubernetes, will try to have an hands-on of further necessary tools

Weekly time: Will devote atleast 5 hours on weekdays and 3 hours on weekends


I know I am gifted in terms of intelligence but that is also something which always drags me down because I always go for shortcuts and last minute learning. It never helped me in the longer run.
That's why..

I WANT TO BE CONSISTENT!! No matter what.
