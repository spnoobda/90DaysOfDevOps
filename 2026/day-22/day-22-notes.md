1. git add is used to get the file from untracked area to staged while git commit gets the file from staging area to tracked.

2. Staging area helps to review changes before it is committed in repository. One can make number of changes in different files if needed before committing them altogether. This helps to maintain a clean commit history for future references.

3. Git log shows all the commit history. It shows the commit message, author who committed, the hash id of commit, date and time when the commit was made.

4. The .git/ folder is the local database for git. It stores the history and the local git logs, config, hooks, refs, HEAD and everything that git needs to function locally. Deleting it would erase all the version control access and make the repository as normal folder.

5. Working directory is a local area where we add, delete or create and make changes to a file, Staging area is where we review our files and make some final adjustments and changes, Repository is where the final version of the file is committed and stored permanently.
