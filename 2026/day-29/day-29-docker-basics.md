TASK 1:

Containers are packages to run different applications without any issue of version or dependencies. Whenever any developer develops an application, often there are cases where the application runs on their device but it fails to run on the client side/device. Container ensures an environment that is consistent and can be run in different devices. Containers are also very lightweight, runs fast and can be scaled.

A virtual machine runs on a very isolated environment, where it has its own complete OS, resources like RAM, storage needs to be alloted explicitly. All this makes VM a high resource using option. On the other hand Docker containers always use shared resources, it runs an OS by sharing it with the default host kernal. This makes it a very lightweight and less heavy on resources.

Docker Images helps to create Docker Containerts, Images are read only and are built from Dockerfile. Docker Daemon runs in the background, it is the main thing which communicates with the registry, containers, and also helps in building an image. Docker Client is the CLI which helps to interact with the Docker Daemon. Docker Containers are the running instances where the application package runs. Docker Registry contains all the public and private images. Docker.hub contains all images, we can also create our own image and upload it there and keep it either as private or public.
